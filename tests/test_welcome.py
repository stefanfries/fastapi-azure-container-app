"""
Unit tests for the FastAPI application.
This module contains tests for the root endpoint ("/") of the FastAPI application.
The tests use the FastAPI TestClient to simulate HTTP requests and verify the responses.
Tests included:
- test_get_welcome: Verifies that a GET request to the root endpoint returns a 200 status code
    and the expected JSON response.
- test_get_welcome_invalid_method: Ensures that a POST request to the root endpoint returns
    a 405 Method Not Allowed status code.
- test_get_welcome_not_found: Checks that a GET request to an invalid endpoint returns a 404
    Not Found status code.
